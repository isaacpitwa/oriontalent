Welcome to the Orion Talent React Native project! This project is set up with various dependencies and scripts to help you get started with building a mobile app. This README file will guide you through the steps required to run the project locally on your development machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (>=18)
- Yarn or npm (Yarn is recommended)
- Expo CLI

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

## Running the App

You can run the app on both iOS and Android simulators/emulators or on physical devices. Make sure you have the necessary simulators/emulators set up or a device connected to your development machine.

### iOS

To run the app on an iOS simulator or device:

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Start the Metro Bundler:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   # or
   npm start
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, run the following command to launch the app on the iOS simulator:

   ```bash
   yarn ios
   # or
   npm run ios
   ```

### Android

To run the app on an Android emulator or device:

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Start the Metro Bundler:
